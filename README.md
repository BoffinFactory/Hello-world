## Welcome to Boffin Factory!

This repository is meant to guide you through beign an active member of the
Boffin Factory.

#### What is the Boffin Factory?

Boffin Factory (room 348 Russ Engineering) is our informal build lab / maker 
space / place to ask weird linux and programming questions.  We do share the 
space with the senior design students but otherwise most tools and workspaces in
the room are free to use.

#### What's the catch?

No catch ;)  Simply follow the rules, stay safe, and help each other out.  Most
rules and safety guides should be posted near the relevant tool or workstation,
if not check out our safety repository.
